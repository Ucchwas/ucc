## Introduction
I have graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I started working as a software engineer at Emerging IT Bangladesh Ltd. where we developed an online education platform for the students of Bangladesh. After six months, I got an opportunity to work with International Developers and moved to Fiftytwo Digital Ltd. My academic and professional goals are focused on making a significant contribution in the field of Machine Learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly excited about the development of novel ML algorithms and efficient autonomous systems with a focus on real-world applications.

## Research Experience
I gained my first major research experience during my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Dr. Mahmuda Naznin. I developed efficient caching schemes in NDN to achieve better performance at the network layer. The motivation behind this work was to eliminate caching redundancy and accommodate as much diverse content as possible in caching systems. Therefore, we introduced a popularity-based caching algorithm.
