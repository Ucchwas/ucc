## Introduction
I have graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I started working as a software engineer at Emerging IT Bangladesh Ltd. where we developed an online education platform for the students of Bangladesh. After six months, I got an opportunity to work with International Developers and moved to Fiftytwo Digital Ltd. My academic and professional goals are focused on making a significant contribution in the field of Machine Learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly excited about the development of novel ML algorithms and efficient autonomous systems with a focus on real-world applications.

## Research Experience
I gained my first major research experience during my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Dr. Mahmuda Naznin. I have done a project in NS-2 simulator in the previous term of selecting undergrad thesis, so I thought that it would help me if I work in Named Data Network(NDN) with NS-3 simulator. I developed efficient caching schemes in NDN to achieve better performance at the network layer. The motivation behind this work was to eliminate caching redundancy and accommodate as much diverse content as possible in caching systems. Therefore, we introduced a popularity-based caching algorithm. We evaluated the performance of our proposed algorithm with other algorithms and compared the impact of network topology, cache capacity, etc. on our algorithm. Currently, I am working on computing patient similarity for clinical decision support by using time series and static data under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Saifur Rahman. We are trying to develop an efficient unsupervised framework to cluster patients by both time series and static data. We are going to introduce reinforcement algorithm to classify time series data.
